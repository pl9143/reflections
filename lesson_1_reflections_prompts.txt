How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	BY DISPLAYING THE 'DIFF' LINES OF EACH FILE. OLDFILE WORKS NEW NOT...

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    TAKES LESS TIME IF YOU HAVE THE CHANGE HISTORY ORGANIZED AAND AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.
	YOU SAVE THE SAME FILE JUST ANOTHER VERSION REATHER THAN RENAMING FILES

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    MANUAL COMMIT IS GOOD BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOU TO TEST THE RESULTS AS MUCH AS YOU WANT/NEED TO.
	MANUAL COMMIT IS BAD BECAUSE THOUGH TESTING IS NOT ALWAAYS PRACTICAL 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    DIFFERENT TYPES OF DOCUMENTS E.G. ARTICLE VERSE CODE... DIFFERENT USAGE REQUIREMENTS 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    IDENTIFY ALL COMMITS "GIT LOG" AND CHECK DIFF OF COMMITS WITH GIT DIFF

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    BY GOING BACK TO THE PREVIOUS WORKING VERSION "EACH COMMIT IS A WORKING VERSION"

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	RELATIONS BETWEEN FILE MAKES IT NECESSARY WORK ON ONE FEATURE/PROBLEM USING MULTIPLE FILES
	
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	GIT LOG WILL TELL ME THE HISTORY AND COMMENTS OF CHANGES 
	GIT CLONE WILL SHOW ME THE CHANGES BETWEEN EACH COMMIT: LINE ANDDED AND DELETED

	 THE GOAL IS NOT TO BREAK SOMETHING BUT IF I DID VERSION CONTROL MAKE IT EASIER TO TROUBLESHHOT AND TRACK WHERE THE PROBLEM IS
