When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working on a shared project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Too much network back and forth with auto updates.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are used to work on others projects without changing original owners work. Forks are used on github only.
	Cloning is used to copy projects from github or local to local computers. Use cloning to make a copy.
	Branches are used to add a feature to the master without altering the master. Use branches to add features to existing work to be merged at a later date.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
